/**
 * Own the manifest link and the service-worker registration for every page.
 *
 * Two problems, one owner:
 *
 * 1. PATHS. vite-plugin-pwa resolves what it injects against `base`, which is
 *    "./" — so it resolves against the PAGE, while manifest.webmanifest and
 *    sw.js only exist at the site root. From /send/ and /receive/ they 404,
 *    which made the receiver — the page the README tells you to add to your
 *    home screen — the one page that never registered a worker at all.
 *    base "./" is what lets one build work under any subpath, so it stays and
 *    the references get a "../" per directory of depth instead.
 *
 * 2. UPDATES. The generated worker only calls skipWaiting() on a SKIP_WAITING
 *    message, and `registerType: "autoUpdate"` leaves sending it to workbox-
 *    window's registration script. A bare register() never does, so every
 *    rebuilt worker installs, parks in "waiting", and the old one goes on
 *    serving its precache indefinitely — a deploy reaches nobody who has
 *    visited before, and locally a hard reload shows your changes while an
 *    ordinary one appears to undo them. The script below does the handshake.
 *
 * Doing both here means `injectRegister: false`, so no generated string is
 * left to depend on.
