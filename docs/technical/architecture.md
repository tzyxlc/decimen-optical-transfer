# Architecture

Three pages, one shared core, a handful of single-purpose build plugins. No framework, no state library — each page is one TypeScript module wiring DOM to the shared code.

## Pages

| dir | page | entry |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | home: cards, share dialog | `home/main.ts` |
| `send/` | file/snippet → fountain-coded QR stream on a canvas | `send/main.ts` |
| `receive/` | camera → WASM QR decode (workers, or main thread on iOS 14) → fountain decoder → file | `receive/main.ts`, `receive/worker.ts` |

The send page carries two non-entry modules: `send/qr-frame.ts`, the one QR
generation path (pinned mask, version locking) shared by the live stream and
the exporter so the two cannot drift apart, and `send/export.ts`, the
animation exporter — the stream rendered into a looping APNG or a
PNG-sequence ZIP, DOM-free so the whole pipeline is Node-tested
(`tests/animation-export.test.ts` pins its frames pixel-for-pixel to the
rasterizer, and its size forecast samples a real frame rather than modeling
one).

## Shared modules (`shared/`)

- `fountain.ts` — LT encoder/decoder, deterministic soliton distribution (see [Protocol](protocol.md)).
- `protocol.ts` — frame header pack/parse, file container, SHA-256 verification, stream identity.
- `frame-capacity.ts` — QR capacity math: payload size → block length / count limits.
- `qr-raster.ts` — QR module matrix → RGBA raster.
- `png.ts` — bilevel (1 bit per pixel, 2-entry palette) PNG primitives: chunk writer, CRC-32, scanline packing with an integer upscale baked in, deflate via the same `CompressionStream` the container uses. Palette rather than grayscale is deliberate — ffmpeg's APNG decoder refuses 1-bit grayscale, which would strand the export for the video pipelines it targets.
- `apng.ts` — APNG assembly over `png.ts`: `acTL`/`fcTL`/`fdAT`, exact rational frame delays, infinite loop.
- `zip.ts` — store-mode ZIP writer for the PNG-sequence export; structure only, the PNGs are already deflated.
- `display.ts` — QR display-size fitting against the viewport.
- `platform.ts` — `isIOS`/`isAndroid` sniffs and camera capability probing (torch, continuous focus, max fps). Policy: probe wherever probeable; sniff only for unprobeable behavior.
- `worker-pool.ts` — decode worker pool; busy workers drop frames, the fountain absorbs it.
- `no-signal.ts` — pure timing policy for the "Nothing happening?" hint (short first delay, longer after dismissal).
- `progress.ts` — frames-collected progress estimation and fountain-overhead model.
- `send-settings.ts` — canonical tx settings lists; the sender's dropdowns and the no-signal advice both render from it.
- `snippet.ts` — text-snippet container type.
- `dialog.ts` — geometric backdrop-click close for `<dialog>`.
- `share-dialog.ts` — the share dialog both home and sender carry (QR + copy + OS sheet).
- `status-line.ts`, `wake-lock.ts`, `format.ts`, `style.css`.

## Build plugins (`build/`)

One file each, exact-match string surgery that **throws when it misses** — markup drift breaks the build instead of shipping broken output.

- `html-tokens.ts` — `%TOKEN%` substitution (site URL, settings options, version, build id).
- `root-pwa-head.ts` — owns the manifest link and SW registration on every page; validates the URLs resolve to the site root under any subpath.
- `rewrite-standalone-links.ts` — strips/rewrites hosted-site references for the single-file builds.
- `inline-codec-wasm.ts`, `use-inline-variants.ts` — inline the decoder wasm/worker for standalone.
- `standalone-csp.ts`, `emit-as.ts` — standalone CSP and output naming.
- `license-banner.ts` — prepends the version/license/source banner to every built artifact.
- `diagnostics-endpoint.ts` — dev-only `/__diagnostics` collector behind `npm run diagnostics` (see [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md)).
- `make-icons.ts` — regenerates `public/` icons from the logo (`npm run icons`, needs librsvg).
- `benchmarks.ts` — promotes captured diagnostics runs to benchmark records and renders the README "Measured speed" section from `benchmarks/records.json` (see [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md)).

## Vendored decoder (`vendor/decimen-codec/`)

The compiled decode engine — a QR-only zxing-cpp build with a tracked fast
path, released separately as
[decimen-codec](https://github.com/bashalarmistalt/decimen-codec). The
artifacts self-identify (banner + `version()`/`build()` exports); licensing
in `NOTICE.md` alongside them.

Typechecking: `tsconfig.json` covers the pages and `shared/`; `tsconfig.node.json` covers `build/` and `vite.config.ts` (both run in `npm run build`). Site and standalone builds target ES2020 so Safari 14 / iOS 14 can parse the entries (no top-level `await`, IIFE decode workers).
